Golang implementation of a B-tree

## About B-tree
A B-tree data structure is a self-ballencing tree data structure. Like a binary search tree, values stored in a b-tree are ordered. This allows for insertion, deleteion, and search operations to happen in logorithmic time. However, unlike a binary search tree, each node in a b-tree may hold more than one value and two children.
